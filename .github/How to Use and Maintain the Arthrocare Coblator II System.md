# How to Use and Maintain the Arthrocare Coblator II System
 
The Arthrocare Coblator II System is a surgical device that uses radiofrequency energy to ablate, resect, and coagulate soft tissue and blood vessels in otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgery. It consists of a controller, a flow control valve unit, a foot control unit, and a disposable wand device that delivers the energy to the target tissue. The system uses patented Coblation technology, which dissolves tissue at the molecular level with minimal thermal effect on surrounding tissue.

In this article, we will explain how to use and maintain the Arthrocare Coblator II System according to the user manual[^1^]. We will also provide some troubleshooting tips and technical specifications for the system.
  
## How to Use the Arthrocare Coblator II System
 
To use the Arthrocare Coblator II System, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Connect the power cord to the controller and plug it into a grounded outlet.
2. Connect the flow control cable to the controller and the flow control valve unit.
3. Connect the foot control unit to the controller.
4. Select a wand device that is appropriate for the surgical application and attach it to the flow control valve unit.
5. Connect a sterile saline bag to the flow control valve unit and hang it on an IV pole.
6. Connect a return electrode pad to the patient's skin near the surgical site and plug it into the controller.
7. Turn on the controller and adjust the settings according to your preference. You can adjust the ablation power, coagulation power, irrigation flow rate, and display brightness using the buttons on the front panel.
8. Press the test button on the controller to verify that the system is functioning properly. You should hear a beep and see a green light on the controller.
9. Press either the ablate or coagulate pedal on the foot control unit to activate the wand device. You should see a blue light on the controller and hear a tone that indicates the mode of operation.
10. Apply the wand device to the target tissue and move it slowly and steadily. You should see bubbles forming around the active electrode tip as the tissue is ablated or coagulated. You should also see smoke being evacuated through the suction tube if present.
11. Release the pedal when you are done with the procedure. You should see a red light on the controller and hear a tone that indicates that the system is idle.
12. Turn off the controller and disconnect all cables and devices. Dispose of the wand device according to your facility's protocol.
