International organizations (IOs) are central actors in the contemporary world of global governance. They shape the norms, rules, policies and practices that affect the lives of billions of people across the globe. But how do IOs work? What are their goals, functions, structures and challenges? How do they interact with other actors, such as states, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society and private sector? And how do they address the most pressing issues facing humanity, such as peace and security, development, human rights and the environment?

These are some of the questions that Margaret P. Karns, Karen A. Mingst and Kendall W. Stiles explore in their comprehensive and engaging book, *International Organizations: The Politics and Processes of Global Governance*. The book, now in its third edition, provides a thorough and updated examination of the full range of IOs, from intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), such as the United Nations (UN), the World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO), to regional organizations, such as the European Union (EU), the African Union (AU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to hybrid organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
  
The book is divided into four parts. The first part introduces the concept of global governance and its theoretical foundations, drawing on various perspectives from international relations, such as realism, liberalism, constructivism and critical theory. The second part examines the historical evolution and institutional design of IOs, highlighting their diversity, complexity and adaptability. The third part analyzes the roles and functions of IOs in four key issue areas: peace and security, development, human rights and the environment. The fourth part evaluates the effectiveness, legitimacy and accountability of IOs, as well as their challenges and prospects for reform.
  
The book is rich in empirical examples and case studies that illustrate the politics and processes of global governance in action. The authors cover a wide range of topics and events, such as the Syrian civil war, the global financial crisis, human trafficking, LGBT rights, climate change and more. They also provide useful features for students and instructors, such as learning objectives, key terms, discussion questions, web resources and suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter.
  
The book is an excellent resource for anyone interested in learning more about IOs and global governance. It is written in a clear, accessible and engaging style that makes it suitable for undergraduate and graduate courses in international relations, political science, global studies and related fields. It is also a valuable reference for scholars, practitioners, policy makers and activists who work with or on IOs.
