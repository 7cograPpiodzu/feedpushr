William Vennard was born in Normal, Illinois, on January 31, 1909. He studied English at Taylor University in Upland, Indiana, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1930. He became interested in music and decided to pursue a career as an opera singer. He studied at Northwestern University earning a Bachelor of Music in Vocal Performance in 1941, followed by graduate studies at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago, where he earned a master's degree in Vocal Performance in 1943.
 
Vennard spent the next several years teaching part-time simultaneously at the Chicago Evangelistic Institute, DePaul University and the American Conservatory. In 1946 he became a member of the faculty of music at the University of Southern California, chairing its voice department from 1950 to 1971. Among the associations to which he belonged are the National Association of Teachers of Singing, which he served in several capacities, including national president. In 1970 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Pepperdine University in recognition of his outstanding contributions to singing and the science of singing.
 
Vennard was renowned as an excellent teacher whose written works have influenced generations of singers, vocal pedagogues and voice scientists. He taught many successful singers including acclaimed mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, who studied under him at the University of Southern California.[1] His book Singing - The Mechanism and The Technic is considered a classic work on vocal technique that combines scientific knowledge with practical guidance. He also collaborated with Janwillem van den Berg to produce a film called Voice Production: The Vibrating Larynx, which won several awards and showed the anatomy and physiology of voice production in the excised larynx.
 
Vennard died in Los Angeles on January 10, 1971, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and excellence in the field of vocal pedagogy. He was a pioneer in the science of singing and in voice pedagogy and was instrumental in fostering collaborative efforts between singers, physicists, psychologists and voice scientists. His book and film are still widely used and referenced by students and teachers of singing around the world.
